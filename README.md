# Microcontrol

Microcontrol is a minimalist tkinter app to have fun about programming microcontrollers.

It gives some tools to use this like a normal microcontroller (with inputs, outputs, and all this type of things)

If you really want to play the game, you shouldn't use any if, loop, addition, substraction or anything else, just use binary operators with numbers.
You can create macro to organize your code.

Have Fun !
